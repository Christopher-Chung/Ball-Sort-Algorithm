# Ball-Sort-Algorithm

This program plays the popular ball sort game, with four balls per tube. The algorithm does not guarantee optimality, but finishes each puzzle with a reasonable amount of moves and takes minimal computing time.

## How to use

First, input the number of tubes (integer) then press enter. Then, treating each color as a different number starting from 1 (ordering does not matter), input the color sequences in the tubes from left to right, top to bottom.

The algorithm should print out all steps after computation, treating the tubes using 0-indexing.
